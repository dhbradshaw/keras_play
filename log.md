It looks like I need to back way up before I can do much that's interesting.  So what I'm going to do is do some reading.  I'll keep a log here just to stay accountable.  The reading list is first the following two links:

For tonight I'm just starting to get things installed.  I used the commands
```
$ python3 -m venv v3
$ . v3/bin/activate
```
Then I tried pip install theano, but it got hairy from there. I think I'll need to install a bunch of C stuff through apt before a successful install.
